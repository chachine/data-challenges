[Tensorflow Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets) provides you with multiple toy datasets.
Four of them are about images:
- `mnist` (challenge 1)
- `fashion mnist`
- `cifar10` (challenge 3)
- `cifar100` (way too complicated, researchers are still working on it)

To help you sharpen your CNN skills and revisit the main concepts learned today, let's try to explore this dataset about clothes.
