Now that the dataset is in the cloud, we are ready to move the training of the model itself to the cloud.

In this challenge, we will discover the third pillar product of the **Google Cloud Platform** suite:

üèç **Compute Engine**, which provides *Virtual Machines*, will allow us to do the actual training in the cloud

<details>
<summary> üîé More on Compute Engine </summary>


  Compute Engine is the service that powers behind the scenes most of the GCP products that require computing capacity.

  It is leveraged by almost all the GCP products. This is why you often see allocated Compute Engine VM instances when you use other GCP products. This is the case for Cloud Run, which you will discover in the second next unit.

  Compute Engine allows us to allocate a custom tailored virtual machine that we can put to sleep when we do not need it anymore. We can create a VM with custom processing power, memory, and disk space, for the duration that we wish.

  It is hard to evaluate properly how to size a machine for a training beforehands. You will have to balance the cost and the capacity of the machine, experiment with the dataset size and observe the training time in order to make up your mind. And possibly opt for [using a GPU](https://kitt.lewagon.com/knowledge/tutorials/vertex_api) or a TPU depending on your goal.

**üíª As always, first install the package of the challenge with `make reinstall_package`**

[//]: # ( challenge instructions )

## Enable the Compute Engine service

In GCP, many services are not enabled by default. The service to activate in order to use _virtual machines_ is **Compute Engine**.

**‚ùì How do you enable a GCP service ?**

Find the `gcloud` command allowing you to enable a **service**.

**üíª Enable the Compute Engine service**

**üß™ Run the tests with `make dev_test`**

üëâ `test_cloud_training_compute_api_enabled` should be ‚úÖ

## Create your first Virtual Machine

The `taxifare_model` package is ready to train on a machine in the cloud. Let's create our first *Virtual Machine* instance!

**‚ùì How do you create a virtual machine ?**

Head towards the GCP console [Compute Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute) page. The console will allow you to explore easilly the options available. Make sure to create an **Ubuntu** instance (read this _How to_, and have a look at the _Hint_).

<details>
<summary> üó∫ How to configure your VM instance </summary>


  Let's explore the options available. The top right of the interface gives you a monthly estimate of the cost for the selected parameters if the VM remains on all the time.

  The basic options should be enough for what we want to do now, except for one: we want to choose the operating system that the VM instance will be running.

  Go to the *Boot disk* section, *CHANGE* the *Operating System* to **Ubuntu** and select the latest **Ubuntu xx.xx LTS** (Long Term Support) version.

  Ubuntu is the familly of operating systems that will ressemble the most the configuration on your machine following the [Le Wagon setup](https://github.com/lewagon/data-setup). Whether you are on a Mac, using Windows WSL2 or on Linux. Selecting this option will allow you to play with a remote machine using the commands you are already familiar with.
</details>

**üíª Create a VM instance and fill the `INSTANCE` variable in the `.env` project configuration**

**üß™ Run the tests with `make dev_test`**

üëâ `test_cloud_training_create_vm` should be ‚úÖ

<details>
<summary> üí° Hint </summary>


  In the future, when you know exactly what type of VM you want to create, you will be able to use the `gcloud compute instances` commands if you want to do everything from the command line. For example:

  ``` bash
  INSTANCE=taxi-instance
  IMAGE_PROJECT=ubuntu-os-cloud
  IMAGE_FAMILY=ubuntu-2110

  gcloud compute instances create ${INSTANCE} --image-project=${IMAGE_PROJECT} --image-family=${IMAGE_FAMILY}
  ```
</details>

**‚ùì How switch ON/OFF your VM ?**

You can easily start and stop a vm instance from the GCP console, which allows to see which instances are running.

<details>
<summary> üí° Hint </summary>


  A faster way to start and stop your virtual machine is to use the command line. The commands still take some time to complete, but you do not have to navigate through the GCP console interface.

  Have a look at the `gcloud compute instances` commands in order to start, stop or list your instances:

  ``` bash
  INSTANCE=taxi-instance

  gcloud compute instances stop ${INSTANCE}
  gcloud compute instances list
  gcloud compute instances start ${INSTANCE}
  ```
</details>

üö® Computing power does not grow on trees üå≥, do not forget to switch the VM off when you stop using it üí∏

## Setup your VM

You have access at arms length to virtually unlimited computing power. Easilly switched on and off. Ready to help with trainings or any tasks.

**‚ùì How do you connect to the VM ?**

The GCP console allows you to connect to the VM instance through a web interface:

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-vm-ssh.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-vm-ssh.png" width="150" alt="gce vm ssh"></a><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-console-ssh.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-console-ssh.png" width="120" alt="gce console ssh"></a>

You can disconnect by typing `exit` or closing the window.

<details>
<summary> üí° Hint </summary>


  You can change the user the web interface connects with if you need to:

  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-web-ssh-switch-login.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-web-ssh-switch-login.png" width="120" alt="gce web ssh switch login"></a>

  A nice alternative is to connect to the virtual machine command line right from your command line ü§©

  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-ssh.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-ssh.png" width="150" alt="gce ssh"></a>

  All you need to do is to `gcloud compute ssh` on a running instance and to run `exit` when you want to disconnect üéâ

  ``` bash
  INSTANCE=taxi-instance

  gcloud compute ssh ${INSTANCE}
  ```

  You can also specify the user to connect with (`gcloud compute ssh ${USERNAME}@${INSTANCE}`).

  If you encounter a `port 22: Connection refused` error, just wait a little more for the VM instance to complete its startup.

  Just run `pwd` or `hostname` if you ever wonder on which machine you are running your commands.
</details>

You are a step away from being able to train your model: you need a development environment to have a data science ready vm üß™

**‚ùì How do you setup the VM to run your python code ?**

Let's run a light version of the [Le Wagon setup](https://github.com/lewagon/data-setup).

**üíª Connect to your VM instance and run the commands of the following sections**

<details>
<summary> ‚öôÔ∏è <code>zsh</code> and <code>omz</code> </summary>


  The **zsh** shell and its **Oh My Zsh** framework are the configuration you are already familiar with. Accept to make zsh the default shell.

  ``` bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y zsh
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
  ```
</details>

<details>
<summary> ‚öôÔ∏è <code>pyenv</code> and <code>pyenv-virtualenv</code> </summary>


  Clone the repos:

  ``` bash
  git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
  git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv
  ```

  Add `pyenv` and `ssh-agent` to the `plugins=(git)` line in the `~/.zshrc`: `plugins=(git pyenv ssh-agent)`, then exit and save:

  ``` bash
  nano ~/.zshrc
  ```

  Add the pyenv initialization script to your `~/.zprofile`:

  ``` bash
  cat << EOF >> ~/.zprofile
  export PYENV_ROOT="\$HOME/.pyenv"
  export PATH="\$PYENV_ROOT/bin:\$PATH"
  eval "\$(pyenv init --path)"
  EOF
  ```

  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Ignore the `zsh: command not found: pyenv` error
</details>

<details>
<summary> ‚öôÔ∏è <code>python</code> </summary>


  Add dependencies required to build python:

  ``` bash
  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
  libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \
  libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev \
  python-dev python3-dev
  ```

  ‚ÑπÔ∏è If a window pops up to ask you which services to restart, just press *Enter*:

  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-apt-services-restart.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-images/master/DE/gce-apt-services-restart.png" width="150" alt="gce apt services restart"></a>

  Install python `3.8.12` and create a `lewagon` virtual env:

  ``` bash
  pyenv install 3.8.12
  pyenv global 3.8.12
  pyenv virtualenv 3.8.12 lewagon
  pyenv global lewagon
  ```
</details>

<details>
<summary> ‚öôÔ∏è <code>git</code> authentication to GitHub </summary>


  Git will be pretty handy to share our code between the vm and your machine. Create a directory to store your git credentials:

  Copy your private key üîë to the vm in order to allow it to access to your GitHub account.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Run this single command on your machine, not in the vm ‚ö†Ô∏è

  ``` bash
  INSTANCE=taxi-instance

  gcloud compute scp ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ${INSTANCE}:~/.ssh/
  ```

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Then resume to running other commands in the vm ‚ö†Ô∏è

  Register the key you just copied:

  ``` bash
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ```

  Enter your *passphrase* if asked to.
</details>

<details>
<summary> ‚öôÔ∏è <em>python</em> code authentication to GCP </summary>


  The code of your package will need to access your data stored in the cloud in Cloud Storage or Big Query.

  In order to do that we will copy your service account json key file üîë to the vm. A more secure option is to create a dedicated *service account* with the appropriate access for your app and upload its json key file to the vm.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Run this single command on your machine, not in the vm ‚ö†Ô∏è

  ``` bash
  INSTANCE=taxi-instance

  gcloud compute scp $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS ${INSTANCE}:~/.ssh/
  gcloud compute ssh ${INSTANCE} --command "echo 'export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.ssh/$(basename $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS)' >> ~/.zshrc"
  ```

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Then resume to running other commands in the vm ‚ö†Ô∏è

  Reload your `~/.zshrc`:

  ``` bash
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```
</details>

**üß™ Run the tests with `make dev_test`**

üëâ `test_cloud_training_default_shell`, `test_cloud_training_pyenv`, `test_cloud_training_python_version` and `test_cloud_training_list_projects` should be ‚úÖ

Your vm is now a data science beast üî•

<details>
<summary> üîé Make a generic data science setup </summary>


  You could decide to proceed with the rest of the [Le Wagon setup](https://github.com/lewagon/data-setup) and install all the packages of the bootcamp on your vm:

  ``` bash
  pip install -U pip
  pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/data-setup/master/specs/releases/linux.txt
  ```

  Keep in mind that, if you did not configure the available disk space, by default the vm will not have enough storage for several virtual environments.

  You can copy your code to the vm by cloning your GitHub project with this syntax (adapt the name of your GitHub repository):

  ``` bash
  git clone git@github.com:<user.github_nickname>/taxi-fare
  ```

  Install the python packages required by your code...

  ``` bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  And run the training!

  ``` bash
  python -m taxifare_model.interface.main
  ```
